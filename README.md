# Voron-Phat-Plinth

This is an adaption of the existing skirts and feet of the Voron V0.2r1
My aim was to bring the outter edges of the skirts and feet out to meet the panels and mounts giving a cleaner look.
The V0.2 is a stunning machine but it does look a bit top heavey.
This new Phat Plinth should address that making the whole printer look more even and solid.

CAD is availible for this model in both .F3d and .STEP

.3MF files are availible if you just want to downloadand print the parts.
